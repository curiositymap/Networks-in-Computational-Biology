# Welcome to the CSX46 GitHub repo

This is the public repository for Jupyter notebooks (and template notebooks)
to be used for in-class work in CS446/546, *Networks in Computational Biology*,
at Oregon State University during Winter 2020. New notebooks will be added to
this repo each week during the quarter. Pull requests welcome!
